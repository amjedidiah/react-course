## Questions

### Education

#### Question 1

My parents noticed my interest in Mathematics at a young age.
My mother encouraged me by holding extra curriculum classes when I got home after school.
When she was not available, she enlisted the help of lesson teachers.
My mother told me that she was very good with Mathematics when she was younger and my father said his father, my grandfather, taught Arithmetic in the primary school in their home town.

My interest grew into competence and soon enough, I was representing my school in Mathematics competitions. This carried on into High School, where I competed at both state and national levels in competitions like the National International Mathematics Olympiad (NIMO), the Mathematics Association of Nigeria(MAN) Competition, Cowbellpedia among others.
I mostly was king of Math in my set for my six years in High School, crying a couple of times when I fell short of 100%.
On multiple occasions, I was called to explain a Math concept to students in a set above me, much to their shame.
I finally scored an A in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in Mathematics.
I wasn't good enough to go for competitions in Physical Sciences, Physics and Chemistry, but I was always among the top 5 students in my class in Physics and in my final year in high school, I was the highest scoring student in the Physics mock exam in my set.
For Chemistry, I mostly performed averagely.

My high school did not have enough computing facilities.
However, my interest in computing was fuelled by my fathers gadgets at home and the video games I played on them and the ones I played on my friend's computers and console when I was on holidays.

#### Question 2

I was a quiet and reserved student for most part. Well-behaved and exemplary.
It was no surprise when I got named Senior Prefect Boy in the 3rd semester of my penultimate year in high school.

Outside of required work, I helped organise the school's football league after my elder brother who started it left for university.
I ended up resigning as the league's coordinator after a year to coach one of the team's I felt had potential to win the league, but were doing poorly.

I was not actively involved in sports, but I participated in a 800m race in the last inter-house sports event I witnessed.
I went on 2 debate competitions, and was also a member of the school's Chapel leadership in my final year.

Mostly I can say I would be remembered for my competence in Mathematics and general school work, my position as Senior prefect, my reservedness, competitions I went for, and short stories I wrote while I was in junior secondary school.

#### Question 3

Languages and the arts were not my strong suits.
I wrote stories in Junior secondary school, but I never got to finish, let alone publish any one.
I had a strong background in French, coming from primary school, but because I di not like my French teacher in junior secondary school, I lost interest and in turn competence in both written and spoken French language.
I failed woefully at my native language, Igbo, until high school where I scored barely enough to pass and ended up with a C6 in the WASSCE.
I was in the school choir in primary school and played the recorder, but all of that went out the window when I got to junior secondary school.

I went for 2 debate competitions, in which my school did not win any.
I scored reasonably high on my essays, so I must have been good to an extent.

All in all, I can say when it came to the Arts and Languages, there was good potential and a good Primary school background, that I did not just work on improving, and in turn lost.

#### Question 4

- Senior Prefect Boy
- Cowbellpedia Mathematics Competition State First Runner-up Junior Category
- Cowbellpedia Mathematics Competition State Champion Senior Category
- Mathematics Association of Nigeria State Champion Senior Category
- A1 in Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Economics in WASSCE
- Chapel Leader

#### Question 5

I chose the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, mostly because both my parents attended the school.
I started out with Dental Surgery but switched to Electronic Engineering after my first year to pursue my passion for computing and programming.

#### Question 6

I did not perform nearly as well as I did in high school in my years in university.
I even had some carry-overs and repeated my 3rd year in Engineering.
Due to the nationwide strike that has been affecting government-owned universities in Nigeria, I still don't know for sure what rank I finished with.

#### Question 7

Outside of class, I spent time, initially in church, later with my fraternity bothers, and much later, towards the end, programming.

#### Question 8

I founded a startup with 4 other students in my class in my 3rd year in the university.
Sadly, it did not do so well and we had to shut it down after a couple of months.
in my final year, I hosted one of the biggest parties in school.

### Web Engineering Experience

#### Question 1: Semantic Markup

Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) so that it reinforces the semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance.
In other words, HTML only focuses on the structure of the page and CSS focuses on the style of the content of the web page.

For instance, when you look at a web page, you can clearly identify a paragraph.
A `<p>` tag indicates that an enclosed text is a paragraph. Again, since the `p` tag is both semantic and presentational, users know this is a paragraph, and browsers know how to display it.

On the other hand, if we use `<div>` or `<span>` in a text, it doesn’t provide any additional meaning to the markup because they are not semantic. Instead, they define only how the text would look like.

##### HTML5 & Semantics

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning(its purpose and content type) to both the browser and the developer, by having its own HTML tag.
HTML included sematic markup since its inception. However, HTML5 introduced even more semantic tags such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<mark>`, and `<time>`, making it clearer what information is on the webpage and what it means.

This is way better than mashing up web pages with `<div>` and `<span>` tags, which are non-semantic and only used to group elements together.
The following HTML5 tags can be used in the place of `<div>` tags to break a page content into meaningful parts:

- `<header>` — Represents a container for introductory content for a section, article, entire web page or a set of navigation links.
- `<nav>` — Navigation menu links would all be placed in a `<nav>` tag.
- `<aside>` — Represents content that’s less important. It’s mostly used for sidebars, and should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
- `<main>` — Specifies main content of the HTML document. The content inside the `<main>` element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms. There should be only one per page.
- `<section>` — A way of grouping together nearby content of a similar theme, typically with a heading. A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
- `<article>` — Represents an independent article on a web page. For example, a blog post.
- `<footer>` — Sits at the base of a page or section, and might include contact information and some site navigation.

##### Benefits of Semantic Markup

1. Accessibility
Semantic markup can help humans(without disabilities) and different assistive applications and devices(such as text-to-speech translators, text size controls, and color and contrast controls, etc), understand the content structure, the relationship among page elements, and the nature of content inside an element and interpret these to people with disabilities.
Thus, ensuring equal access for people with disabilities and providing more options to customize their experience.

2. Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
Semantic markup provides better instructions for web(search engine) crawlers when scanning pages for content, by telling them what important content is on the page.
This can result in search engines ranking the page using the most relevant and meaningful content on the page and ensuring that the right pages are delivered for the right queries.

3. Maintainability
Semantic markup is easier to update and change than web pages that contain a great deal of presentation markup, because it makes the code clearer and organizes it in a logical way.

4. Quality Code
Sematic markup helps us think about the structure of dynamic data, and to choose titles' hierarchy properly.

#### Question 2: Box Model

> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes

In CSS, the term _box model_ is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a container that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: _margins_, _borders_, _padding_, and the actual _content_. The image below illustrates the box model:

![CSS Box Model](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*E_YuB8x1B3T3h6PIJ_I9qQ.png)

- **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content
- **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

> The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

##### Width and Height of an Element

By default, a block-level element will take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
To set the width and height of an element, we can use the width and height properties.
By default, when the width and height properties of an element is set with CSS, it's just the width and height of the _content_ area that is set. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

For instance:

```css
div {
  width: 320px;
  height: 220px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

The width of the div element is 320px(width) + 15px(left border) + 15px(right border) + 50px(left padding) + 50px(right padding) = 450px

The height of the div element is 220px(height) + 15px(top border) + 15px(bottom border) + 50px(top padding) + 50px(bottom padding) = 350px.

However, when the `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box`, the padding and border are included in the width and height.

```css
div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 320px;
  height: 220px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

The width of the div element is 320px.

The height of the div element is 220px.
